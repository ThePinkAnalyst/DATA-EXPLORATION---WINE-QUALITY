# 1. Executive Summary
## Overview
This dataset consists of 11 chemical properties of red wine, with a focus on their relationship to the wine's quality rating, which is determined by human tasters. The chemical properties include variables such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol content. These variables are critical to understanding and predicting wine quality.

## Goal
The objective of this analysis is to explore the dataset and gain insights into the relationships between chemical properties and the wine quality rating. The analysis focuses on identifying correlations, outliers, and patterns in the dataset that affect wine quality.

## Key Steps
* Importing the dataset into a Jupyter environment.
* Cleaning the data: handling missing values, removing duplicates, and managing outliers.
* Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), including visualizations and summary statistics.
* Analyzing the relationships between chemical properties and wine quality.
* Interpreting results, identifying limitations, and proposing future work.

# 2. Methods and Analysis
## Data Preparation
* Importing Data: The dataset was imported into Jupyter using Pandas for further analysis. Key functions such as .info() and .describe() were used to inspect the dataset for missing data, data types, and distribution of variables.
* Data Cleaning:
  * The info() function revealed that no null or missing values were present in the data. The duplicated() function was used to detect and remove duplicated rows.
  * Outliers were identified using box plots and handled using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Outliers beyond the lower and upper bounds of the IQR were replaced with NaN and then removed using dropna().

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Unique Quality Ratings
The dataset contains four unique quality ratings: 4, 5, 6, and 7. Figure 1 illustrates the histogram showing the distribution of these quality ratings, with most wines rated as 5 and 6.

### Correlation Between Chemical Properties and Quality
A correlation matrix was generated to understand the relationship between chemical properties and wine quality. Key insights include:
* Positive Correlation: Alcohol content has the highest positive correlation with quality, meaning that higher alcohol content generally results in higher wine quality.
* Negative Correlation: Volatile acidity shows a strong negative correlation with quality. As volatile acidity increases, wine quality decreases.
* Weak Correlations: Free sulfur dioxide and residual sugar show weak correlations with quality.

### Distribution of Fixed Acidity

This shows the overall distribution of fixed acidity, which is right-skewed with a skewness value of approximately 0.71. The data for quality ratings of 5 and 6 are also right-skewed, while quality ratings of 4 and 7 have more uniform distributions.

### Relationship Between Residual Sugar and Density
The correlation between residual sugar and density is moderate, with a value of 0.4. Scatterplots (Figures 6 and 7) show that while residual sugar and density tend to increase together, the correlation is not very strong, as the data points are widely scattered.

Handling Outliers
Outliers were detected using the IQR method and box plots for each chemical property (Figures 8 and 9 show an example for density). Outliers were removed from the dataset, as their presence could distort the analysis and lead to misleading results. The IQR method is less sensitive to outliers and was chosen for its robustness in this chemical test context.

### Relationships Between Chemical Properties
Several key relationships between the chemical properties were explored:
* Fixed Acidity and Citric Acid: Positive relationship, where higher values of both tend to produce higher-quality wines.
* Fixed Acidity and Density: Positive relationship, but lower densities combined with higher fixed acidity tend to yield higher-quality wines.
* Fixed Acidity and pH: Negative relationship, meaning as fixed acidity increases, pH decreases.
* Volatile Acidity and Citric Acid: Negative relationship, where higher citric acid and lower volatile acidity are associated with higher-quality wines.
* Free Sulfur Dioxide and Total Sulfur Dioxide: Positive relationship, where higher values of both are typically observed together.

# 3. Results and Conclusion
Summary
The analysis yielded the following insights:
* There are four unique quality ratings in the dataset: 4, 5, 6, and 7.
* Alcohol content has the highest positive correlation with wine quality.
* Volatile acidity has the strongest negative correlation with wine quality.
* Fixed acidity is right-skewed across different quality ratings, particularly for wines rated 5 and 6.
* Residual sugar and density show a weak positive correlation.
* Handling outliers was crucial to improving the reliability of the analysis. The IQR method was effective in removing extreme values without affecting the overall trends in the data.
* Relationships between chemical properties suggest that wines with a combination of high fixed acidity and low density or high citric acid content tend to have higher quality ratings.

# 4. Limitations and Constraints
* Data Quality: The source, age, and quality of the data are unknown. Without knowledge of the methods used for wine testing, the accuracy of the data cannot be verified.
* Lack of Standardization: Exploratory analysis depends heavily on qualitative insights, which can introduce biases.
* Dataset Limitations: The dataset lacks features such as grape variety, region, or tasting notes, which might have provided deeper insights into wine quality.

# 5. Suggestions for Future Work
* Further analysis could explore the combined effect of fixed acidity and high citric acid on wine quality.
* Investigating the impact of volatile acidity and citric acid on the taste and quality of wine could provide more actionable insights.
* Additional data on wine characteristics (e.g., vintage year, grape variety) could be incorporated to refine the analysis.
